# Spring and Spring Boot Basics

Contains the learnings and implementation of **Spring** and **Spring Boot**

---
## 📌 Loose Coupling

- **Loose Coupling** is a design principle that aims to reduce the dependencies between components within a system.

## 📌 Inversion of Control (IOC)

- **Inversion of Control** is a design principle where the control of object creation and lifecycle management is transferred from the application code to an external container or framework.

## 📌 Dependency Injection (DI)

- **Dependency Injection** is a design pattern commonly used in OOP, where the dependencies of a class are provided externally rather than being created within the class itself.

## 📌 Beans

- Objects that are managed by frameworks are called **Beans**.

## 📌 Spring Container
- **Spring Container** is the core part of Spring that creates, configures, and manages application objects (beans) and handles their dependency injection automatically.
- Two Types of Spring Containers:
  - Application Context
  - Bean Factory
